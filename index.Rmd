# Introduction

Hi! I’m Peng Su, first year Master students in Biostatistics, and majored in Bioinformatics as an undergraduate. I’m really interested in using high-throughput and multi-omics data to investigate biological functions especially tumor immune related pathways and discover novel therapeutic loci and signatures.

I have four years of experience using R and master basic python and JAVA technology. Additionally, I have also participated in researches that use genomic data to build cancer immune prognostic model, as well as summarize immune-related signatures using big data and existing databases.

The dashboard can be found [here](dashboard.html)

This dashboard using the `instacart` data set and only focus on items that have been repurchased and customers who have made more than 20 purchases.

The bar chart have displayed the amount number of department that purchased by the users, and from the char A, it is noticeable that products in `produce` department sells the most.

Scatter plot in chart B represents the relationship between order time and days since the last order of 1000 randomly selected data, where different colors represent different order sequences, this scatter plot helps to analyze the distribution of order sequences of different products at different times and the number of days since the last order.

The chart C has displayed the distribution of the  order number across a week, it seems that there was little difference in the amount purchased each day of the week.


Wish you have a great day!

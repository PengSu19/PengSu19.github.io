# Introduction

Hi! I’m Peng Su, first year Master students in Biostatistics, and majored in Bioinformatics as an undergraduate. I’m really interested in using high-throughput and multi-omics data to investigate biological functions especially tumor immune related pathways and discover novel therapeutic loci and signatures.

I have four years of experience using R and master basic python and JAVA technology. Additionally, I have also participated in researches that use genomic data to build cancer immune prognostic model, as well as summarize immune-related signatures using big data and existing databases.
